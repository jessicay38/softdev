DISCO:
- Using just a flask file and the prompt gives a basic implementation but it uses a lot of non-ideal libraries
- It tells you what other repositories it's drawing inspiration from
- First attempt sort of works, it lets an user create stories, add stories, but you can't see the full story and you can't see other people's stories 
- Sometimes it does side by side 
- It's much slower than ChatGBT
