# K15 - Displaying user input with flask
# October 8, 2024
# Time Spent: 30 minutes

# import conventions:
# list most general first (standard python library)
# ...then pip installs (eg Flask)
# ...then your own home-rolled modules/packages (today's test module)

from flask import Flask             #facilitate flask webserving
from flask import render_template   #facilitate jinja templating
from flask import request           #facilitate form submission

import testmod0

#the conventional way:
#from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__)    #create Flask object

trioTASK:
~~~~~~~~~~~ BEFORE RUNNING THIS, ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
...read for understanding all of the code below.
 * Some will work as written;
 *  ...other sections will not. 

TASK:
 Predict which.
 1. Devise simple tests to isolate components/behaviors.
 2. Execute your tests.
 3. Process results.
 4. Findings yield new ideas for more tests? Yes: do them.

PROTIP: Insert your own in-line comments
 wherever they will help
  your future self and/or current teammates
   understand what is going on.
